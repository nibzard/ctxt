# Contributing to ctxt.help

We love your input! We want to make contributing to ctxt.help as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## Development Process

We use GitHub to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

### Pull Requests

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `main`
2. If you've added code that should be tested, add tests
3. If you've changed APIs, update the documentation
4. Ensure the test suite passes
5. Make sure your code lints
6. Issue that pull request!

### Branch Naming Convention

- `feature/` - New features (`feature/mcp-server-integration`)
- `fix/` - Bug fixes (`fix/conversion-error-handling`)
- `docs/` - Documentation (`docs/api-reference`)
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring (`refactor/context-block-component`)

### Commit Message Format

```
type(scope): brief description

- Detailed explanation if needed
- Use bullet points for multiple changes
- Reference issues: Closes #123

Types: feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore
Scopes: frontend, backend, mcp-server, docs, deploy
```

Examples:
```
feat(frontend): add drag-and-drop context block reordering

- Implement React DnD for context blocks
- Add visual feedback during drag operations
- Update block order in state management

fix(backend): resolve SEO slug generation conflicts

- Add uniqueness check with MD5 fallback
- Handle special characters in titles
- Closes #45
```

## Code Style

### TypeScript (Frontend & MCP Server)
- Use strict typing with explicit interfaces
- Prefer explicit return types for functions
- Use const assertions for immutable data
- Follow React component naming conventions

### Python (Backend)
- Use type hints for all function signatures
- Follow PEP 8 style guide
- Use Pydantic models for request/response schemas
- Document all public functions with docstrings

### File Naming
- **Files**: kebab-case (`context-builder.tsx`, `conversion-service.py`)
- **Directories**: kebab-case (`mcp-server`, `api-routes`)
- **Classes**: PascalCase (`ContextBuilder`, `ConversionService`)
- **Functions/Variables**: camelCase (TS) / snake_case (Python)
- **Constants**: SCREAMING_SNAKE_CASE (`API_BASE_URL`, `RATE_LIMIT_FREE`)

## Testing

### Frontend (Jest + React Testing Library)
```bash
cd frontend
npm test              # Run tests
npm run test:coverage # Generate coverage report
npm run test:e2e      # End-to-end tests
```

**Coverage Requirements**: >80%

### Backend (Pytest)
```bash
cd backend
pytest tests/ -v      # Run all tests
pytest --cov=app     # Generate coverage report
```

**Coverage Requirements**: >85%

### MCP Server (Jest)
```bash
cd mcp-server
npm test              # Run tests
npm run test:integration # Integration tests
```

## Bug Reports

We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by opening a new issue.

**Great Bug Reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Feature Requests

We use GitHub issues to track feature requests as well. When requesting a feature:

- Explain the problem you're trying to solve
- Describe the solution you'd like
- Describe alternatives you've considered
- Include mockups or examples if applicable

## Security Vulnerabilities

If you discover a security vulnerability, please send an email to security@ctxt.help instead of opening a public issue.
